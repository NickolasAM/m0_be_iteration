# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
I feel better after taking notes and practicing.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
I had a productive strugggle it took some repitition to get things down. Looking up documentation and huddling with my group memebers helped out. This made me feel productive and successful in finding ways to get it done.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I need to give more practice to Ruby. I feel with repitiion it makes everything that much easier.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
I have question regarding shortcuts but i feel that will come with time of repeating and reasearching these actions.
